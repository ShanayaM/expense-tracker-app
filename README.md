# Expense Tracker

Keep track of your expenses by logging them in the app using your phone's camera.

The idea is to:
- Scan an invoice and get basic details from the invoice such as the name of the vendor, the date and the total amount spent.
- Store the details from the invoice.
- View past expenses.
- Edit details extracted from the invoice.
